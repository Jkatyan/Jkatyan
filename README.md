**üåØ Projects**

- Predicting Human Pose in Real Time with Deep Learning

  - *Several applications in bio-mechanical engineering, gaming, and biofeedback/rehabilitation require a human‚Äôs skeletal configuration to be captured. With deep learning, real-time prediction of human pose with minimal hardware input and inexpensive infrastructure becomes possible. This project uses a deep neural network to process time-series data and to predict human pose instantaneously.*

- IRYS, ADHD Diagnosis Tool

  - *With ADHD in children rising every year, there needs to be a solution to combat this. Introducing: IRYS, an ADHD diagnosis program using eye-tracking and machine learning for more accurate prognosis.*

- ZETA

  - *Affordable Cloud-Based Machine Learning Framework*

  - [Project Repository](https://github.com/1sigmoid/zeta-backend)
 
- Track Force

  - *Contact-free, modular, swerve module movement through IR, IMU, and Ultrasonic input. TrackForce allows you to manipulate objects without direct contact, helping to stop the spread of COVID-19.*
